# Max Pane

A fullscreen macOS app where terminals and web views are peer panes, arranged as
portrait-bounded columns ("lanes") on an infinite horizontal strip. A supervision
surface for agentic CLI work: watch several agents run while reading what they
cite, in columns, not overlapping windows.

The spec is [`docs/PRDSwift.md`](docs/PRDSwift.md). This README is the source of
truth for how to build and work on it.

**Design invariant:** a lane is a portrait-bounded column. Wide content scrolls
inside the lane; the lane never widens past its max.

## Layout

```
crates/laned-core/     Rust. The ledger, ordinals, tagging, search, eviction policy.
                       Platform-agnostic — no AppKit concepts leak in here.
swift/MaxPaneCore/     The Rust core as a Swift module (uniffi-generated).
swift/MaxPane/         The app. Rendering, input, WKWebView/SwiftTerm lifetimes.
spikes/                Phase 0 spike programs. Kept: they are how the numbers
                       in docs/spikes/ were obtained.
docs/decisions/        ADRs. One per open decision in PRD §14.
docs/spikes/           Spike reports, with measured numbers.
docs/reference/        External protocol references (RelayTTY).
docs/proposals/        Proposed changes to external dependencies. See "RelayTTY".
```

**Everything durable lives in `laned-core`.** The Swift app is a view. If a piece
of state would be lost when the app quits, it is in the wrong place.

---

## Toolchain

This machine has **Command Line Tools, not Xcode**. `xcodebuild` does not work and
is not needed: the app is a SwiftPM package, and the `.app` bundle is assembled by
hand and ad-hoc signed. Do not introduce an `.xcodeproj`.

Homebrew's `rust` formula (1.86) shadows rustup in `PATH` and is too old for
uniffi 0.32. `rust-toolchain.toml` pins stable, but only rustup's shims honour it:

```sh
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/rustup/bin:$PATH"   # or: source scripts/env.sh
```

Everything in `scripts/` does this for you.

## Build

```sh
./scripts/gen-bindings.sh      # build laned-core, regenerate the Swift bindings
cd swift/MaxPane && swift build
```

Re-run `gen-bindings.sh` after changing any `#[uniffi::export]` signature. The
generated module **must** be called `laned_coreFFI` — the generated Swift does
`#if canImport(laned_coreFFI)`, and a different name compiles cleanly with no FFI
symbols at all, which fails at link time in a thoroughly unhelpful way.

## Test

```sh
source scripts/env.sh
cargo test                                    # unit + durability acceptance tests
cargo test --release --test snapshot_cost -- --nocapture   # the M3 timing split
```

`crates/laned-core/tests/durability.rs` holds the half of PRD §15's acceptance
tests that the core owns — mostly "the strip is identical after a `kill -9`",
which it proves by dropping `Core` with no shutdown path and reopening the file.

---

## RelayTTY

`/Users/spierce/code/relay-tty` is a **stable external dependency and is
read-only**. Do not modify its wire protocol. If the app needs something the
protocol does not offer, write a proposal in `docs/proposals/` and stop.

Its `PROTOCOL.md` is stale and wrong in 17 places. Use
[`docs/reference/relay-integration.md`](docs/reference/relay-integration.md),
which was written from the Rust pty-host source and cites it.

---

## Conventions

- **Commit the mutation before animating it.** Every layout change is a
  synchronous SQLite write that happens before the UI moves. A `kill -9` may cost
  pixels; it may not cost order.
- **The system never reorders.** Lanes move because the user moved them. Tagging,
  search and gather are all read-only over ordinals.
- **Never edit a shipped migration.** Add a new numbered file in
  `crates/laned-core/migrations/`.
- **Spikes keep their code.** A number in `docs/spikes/` is only trustworthy if
  the program that produced it is still runnable.
- When reality contradicts the PRD, surface the conflict in an ADR rather than
  silently reinterpreting the requirement.
